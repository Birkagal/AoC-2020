# ðŸŽ„Advent Of Code 2020ðŸŽ„
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
<br /> 
This is my first time solving AoC, and I chose to solve this year puzzles using Python in order to learn more and get some experience with it.
I had a lot of fun, and I surley learned A LOT!
