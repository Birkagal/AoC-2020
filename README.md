# ðŸŽ„Advent Of CodeðŸŽ„
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
<br /> 
I started solving AoC in 2020, and after missing last year challanges I'm back again at it in 2022.
I'm still solving the challanges using Python.
